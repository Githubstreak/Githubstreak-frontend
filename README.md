# GitHubStreak

GitHubStreak is an open-source project that aims to rank developers based on their contributions to GitHub repositories and the number of consecutive days they have committed code (known as a "streak"). This project serves as a valuable tool for developers to showcase their commitment and activity on GitHub, and for potential employers or collaborators to identify dedicated and productive contributors.

## Features

- **Contribution Ranking**: Developers are ranked based on the number of contributions (commits, pull requests, issues, etc.) they have made to GitHub repositories.
- **Streak Tracking**: The application tracks and displays the longest streak of consecutive days a developer has committed code to a repository.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard showcases the top-ranked developers based on their contributions and streaks.
- **User Profiles**: Detailed profiles for each developer, displaying their contributions, streak history, and other relevant information.
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHubStreak seamlessly integrates with the GitHub API to fetch and analyze developer data.
